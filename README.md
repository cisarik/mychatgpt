# MyChatGPT ‚Äì MV3 Extension

MyChatGPT keeps your ChatGPT account tidy while storing short ‚Äúsearch-like‚Äù chats locally. The extension watches for short conversations created by the official ChatGPT browser companion, backs them up to IndexedDB, and‚Äîwhen you explicitly allow it‚Äîcan soft-hide them using the same API the web client uses.

## Key ideas
- Local-first safety: backups live in IndexedDB (`mychatgpt-db`); nothing ever leaves your machine.
- Safe defaults: `LIST_ONLY` and `DRY_RUN` ship as `true`, so no PATCH requests fire unless you disable both *and* confirm.
- Transparent logging: the Debug tab streams the last 500 log entries from `chrome.storage.local`.
- Modular UI: popup offers Searches, Backup, Settings, and Debug tabs with dark-mode aware styling.

## Loading the extension
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. In Chrome/Brave, open `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Toggle on **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project directory.
5. Pin the ‚ÄúMyChatGPT‚Äù extension if you want quick access to the popup.

## How to test KROK 2
1. Load the unpacked extension, then open a short ChatGPT conversation (‚â§2 visible messages, ‚â•2 minutes old).
2. Keep the popup open on **Searches**. When you focus the chat tab, the Debug tab should log `Scan started` and either `Backup stored` or the disqualification reason.
3. Click **Backup current chat (manual)** to force a capture; with default settings the toast shows the LIST_ONLY guard unless you flip `ALLOW_LOCAL_BACKUP_WHEN_LIST_ONLY` or disable `LIST_ONLY` entirely.
4. Visit the **Backup** tab to see the newest entry, change its category, preview the sanitized answer, and export the HTML snapshot.
5. Toggle `LIST_ONLY` off in **Settings** and repeat the manual backup to confirm that records persist when the guard rails allow it.

## Diagnostics
- Enable verbose tracing in **Settings > Diagnostics** by setting `DEBUG_LEVEL` to `TRACE` and toggling `TRACE_EXTRACTOR` or `TRACE_RUNNER` as needed; keep `REDACT_TEXT_IN_DIAGNOSTICS` enabled when you want message bodies redacted.
- Use the Debug tab's **Run extractor self-test (active tab)** button to execute the new probe. The result shows selectors tried, warnings, and errors, and the **Copy JSON** shortcut lets you share the snapshot locally.
- Flip on `DIAGNOSTICS_SAFE_SNAPSHOT` to persist the last probe into `debug_last_extractor_dump`; the Debug tab renders the most recent snapshot for quick review.
- Open the service worker console via `chrome://extensions -> MyChatGPT -> "Service worker" -> Inspect` to watch streaming logs. Reason codes such as `cooldown_active`, `tab_ignored_safe_url`, `qualify_false_messages_gt_max`, `qualify_true`, `probe_failed`, and `backup_stored` map directly to runner decision points.

## Auto-scan & Would-delete (simulated)
- The service worker auto-scans chatgpt.com tabs when the extension installs, Chrome starts, or a chat tab activates/completes loading. Per-tab and global cooldown timers (respecting `COOLDOWN_MIN`) prevent excessive polling, and SAFE URL patterns continue to short-circuit eligible pages.
- Conversations qualify for the simulated ‚Äúwould-delete‚Äù list only when they meet the heuristics: `messageCount ‚â§ MAX_MESSAGES`, `userMessageCount ‚â§ USER_MESSAGES_MAX`, `lastMessageAgeMin ‚â• MIN_AGE_MINUTES`, and within the optional `DELETE_LIMIT`. Missing metadata or safe-domain matches keep them off the list.
- LIST_ONLY and DRY_RUN stay enabled by default, so the feature never issues real DELETE/PATCH requests. The Debug report is strictly a preview of what *would* be deleted.
- Open **Debug ‚Üí Would-delete report (simulated)** to refresh counters, export `mychatgpt_would_delete.csv`, clear the log, or trigger **Scan all open chat tabs now** for a manual sweep. The popup badge mirrors the current qualified count so you can jump straight to Debug.

## Soft-delete DRY-RUN (no network)
- Open **Debug ‚Üí Soft-delete DRY-RUN plan** to build a PATCH preview from the latest would-delete snapshot. Each entry shows the synthetic request (`PATCH /conversation/{id}` with `{is_visible:false}`) plus a diff preview (`is_visible: true ‚Üí false`).
- The justification viewer explains why each conversation qualifies, including the age/message heuristics and any disqualifying flags; the same reason codes appear in the Debug logs.
- Use **Regenerate plan from current report** after an auto-scan to refresh the plan (respecting `REPORT_LIMIT` and deduplicated by conversation). **Simulate batch confirm (log-only)** only appends to `soft_delete_confirmed_history` and logs `dry_run_confirmed`; nothing hits the network.
- Export the JSON plan for external review, clear the plan if you want to start over, and rely on the popup badge to track how many DRY-RUN deletions are staged.

## Live Safe Mode (real PATCH with guard rails)
- Arm Live Mode only when **all** safety toggles agree: set `LIST_ONLY=false`, `DRY_RUN=false`, and `LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true`. The Debug badge switches from **SAFE (dry-run)** to **ARMED (live)** once every guard is off.
- Real PATCH requests are dispatched via a page-context bridge (`bridge.js`) injected into chatgpt.com. Because the bridge runs in the main world it reuses the site's cookies, bypasses CORS, and never exposes credentials to the extension process.
- Live settings expose a host whitelist, per-minute rate limiter, and per-batch limit that is additionally gated by `DELETE_LIMIT`. The Debug card loads candidates from the DRY-RUN plan into a checkbox table; you must explicitly confirm the batch in a modal and acknowledge the final warning before any PATCH fires.
- Successful items are logged with `patch_ok`, appended to `soft_delete_confirmed_history`, and summarized under **Last LIVE batch**. Blocked items surface reason codes such as `patch_blocked_by_whitelist`, `patch_blocked_by_rate_limit`, or `patch_bridge_timeout` so you know why they stayed local.

## Undo (make visible:true) & Audit trail
- Toggle **Settings ‚Üí Safety ‚Üí SHOW_UNDO_TOOLS** if you want to hide or reveal the new Undo card. The queue accepts manual entries (conversation ID, optional URL/title) and can auto-fill from the last 24 hours of `soft_delete_confirmed_history` via **Load recent hidden**.
- Undo batches reuse the same guard rails as Live hides: `LIST_ONLY=false`, `DRY_RUN=false`, `LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true`, whitelist checks, rate limiting, and the dedicated `UNDO_BATCH_LIMIT`. Every request sends `{is_visible:true}` through the page bridge and records the outcome locally.
- Each Undo or hide action writes to the local audit log (`chrome.storage.local.audit_log`). The Debug ‚Üí **Audit trail** card tails the last _N_ entries, filters by op/reason/status, and exports CSV/JSON with timestamps, URLs, status codes, and reason codes.
- Add contextual notes directly from the Live/Undo result lists via **Add to Audit notes**. Notes persist in the audit log and export payloads so you can annotate why a change happened.
- The popup now shows a üïí badge with the count of hidden conversations in the last 24 hours; clicking it jumps straight to Debug ‚Üí Audit trail filtered to `op=hide` for quick review.

### Live Mode troubleshooting
- `no_injection`: force-inject the content script from Debug or reload the chat tab; the bridge only loads on `https://chatgpt.com` in the top frame.
- `patch_bridge_timeout`: ensure at least one active chatgpt.com tab is open and focused; the bridge fetch relies on the page context.
- `patch_http_error_401/403`: refresh chatgpt.com to refresh cookies or reauthenticate before retrying.
- To re-arm, flip any of `LIST_ONLY`, `DRY_RUN`, or `LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` back to `true`, then disable them in sequence once you are ready to run another live batch.

## Endpoint autodetection & headers
- Visibility toggles now iterate through multiple REST shapes: `PATCH /backend-api/conversation/{id}`, `PATCH /backend-api/conversations/{id}`, and POST fallbacks with the same JSON body. The bridge stops at the first `2xx` responder and logs each attempt.
- When an access token is present, requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `content-type: application/json`, `X-Same-Domain: 1`, and `credentials: 'include'` so the page context mirrors the web client's auth setup.
- Debug logs and the Endpoint diagnostics panel show which combinations were tried and the status codes that came back, making it easy to spot 405/404/403 responses.

### Endpoint probe workflow
- Open **Debug ‚Üí Live Mode ‚Üí Endpoint diagnostics**, enter a conversation ID, and click **Probe endpoint**.
- With `DRY_RUN=true` the probe limits itself to `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` requests so visibility stays untouched; once Live Mode is armed it replays the detected method with the current `is_visible` value, keeping the conversation state intact.
- The JSON output highlights whether an access token was attached, the first successful method/URL pair, and the first few attempts. Run it whenever live batches return HTTP `405`, `404`, or `403` to confirm which endpoint the server currently honors.

## Troubleshooting `no_injection`
If you see `reasonCode=no_injection` in the logs, open the **Debug** tab, click **Force inject content script**, or reload the chat tab. Remember to reload the extension after any manifest changes.

## Troubleshooting `cooldown_active`
`cooldown_active` means the per-tab or global cooldown is still in effect. Wait for the configured `COOLDOWN_MIN` interval or launch **Scan all open chat tabs now** from Debug with the cooldown bypass.

## Current limitations
- DOM scraping relies on data attributes from chatgpt.com; major UI changes can break extraction until heuristics are updated.
- Runner never issues PATCH/DELETE calls‚Äî`DRY_RUN` remains in place and only local backups/logs are produced.
- No automated tests yet; verify flows manually through the popup and Debug tab.

## Development notes
- Manifest V3, background service worker written as an ES module.
- IndexedDB stores `backups` and `categories`; the latter is seeded with `Programovanie`, `Kryptomeny`, `HW`, and `Zdravie` on first run.
- Comments and docstrings live in Slovak per the Analytic Programming protocol.
- No external dependencies or build steps; everything is plain JS + HTML + CSS.
